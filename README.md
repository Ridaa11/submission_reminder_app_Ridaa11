# submission_reminder_app_Ridaa11
Task 1 :I created a shell script named create_environment.sh that sets up the workin genvironmenrt for the submission reminder app .it includes files like Submissions .txt that contains sampke records of students' submission status. And other files like config.env,reminder.sh,functions.sh,startup.sh that contai codes that will help the program ro run smoothely.
Task 2:I cerated the copilot shell script named copilot_shell_script.sh that prompts the user to enter the assignment name then the new input will replace the current one and generate the submission status of the new assignment.
Task 3: It was about branching and merging the files to make sure that Create_environment.sh,copilot_shell_script and README.md are all present in the main branch.
